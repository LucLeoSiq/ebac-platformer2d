# EBAC - Platformer 2D ðŸŽ®

Made as part of the coursework for the EBAC "Unity Developer" course, with the intent to teach students the basics of Unity by building a simple platformer level with  very basics features. 

Used as an introduction to topics such as: C# programming, Unity Scene structure, movement, animation, items, enemies, Scriptable Objects, VFX, and Sound in the Unity Engine.

All these topics as well as the Unity Engine where new to me, so the purpose of the project was to familiarize myself with them to gain a greater understanding to progress to other projects.
